# Pipeline Development Log

> A running journal of pipeline experiments, tuning attempts, bake-off results, and decisions. **Newest entries at top.** Append-only — never edit historical entries; correct via a follow-up entry instead.
>
> The architecture decision record at [`PDF-PROCESSOR.md`](./PDF-PROCESSOR.md) captures *stable* decisions. This file captures the *empirical work* that produces them. Bake-off result tables, prompt-tuning A/Bs, model-swap experiments, dead-ends — all go here. The audience is future-Blake, future-Claude, and future contributors trying to understand "why is this pipeline configured this way?"

## Quick index — all experiments to date

Best multipass-fhir result on Cedars Health Summary: **F1 0.70** (post-Move H, with `findable_only=True` + GT dedup).

| Date | Move | Subject | Headline result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-03 | **T** | Empty-state + loading UI on the harmonize page | Three render branches now handle the previously-unreachable zero-collections state gracefully. Centered empty-state card explains what's missing and offers two CTAs (upload documents in-app, Synthea quick-start external). Closes the fresh-clone polish loop. |
| 2026-05-03 | **S** | Synthea demo collection — fresh-clone reviewers get a working harmonize flow | Self-bootstrapping cross-source dataset from public Synthea data. One patient bundle split into 2 temporal EHR snapshots, persistent identity + chronic conditions carry forward. **9 conditions / 8 cross-source merged** without any private data. blake-real now registers conditionally so fresh clones don't see an empty collection. |
| 2026-05-03 | **R** | Multi-source contribution diff — vision wins surface automatically | Per-source unique vs shared partitioning. **The 4 Cedars PDF unique conditions auto-emerge as exactly the vision wins from Move H** — manual triage replaced by a graph query. Function Health 2025-11-29 has 0 unique / 58 shared, automatically exposing it as a cross-source confirmation source rather than a unique-data source. |
| 2026-05-03 | **Q** | Bidirectional Provenance walk | New endpoint + clickable Sources rows. From any DocumentReference, see every merged fact it contributed. **Cedars FHIR contributes 207 facts; Cedars PDF contributes 160** on blake-real, broken down per resource type. The Atlas Provenance wedge is now directly demoable from both directions. |
| 2026-05-03 | **P** | Allergies + Immunizations matchers — USCDI clinical core complete | 4th and 5th resource types ported. **1/1 allergies + 8/10 immunization events cross-source merged** on Cedars FHIR + PDF. Five tabs in the React app now: Labs / Conditions / Medications / Allergies / Immunizations. |
| 2026-05-03 | **O** | Medications matcher + Medications tab | Third resource type ported. RxNorm overlap → drug-name canonicalize → drug-name bridge → passthrough. **6 of 7 medications cross-source merged** on Cedars FHIR + PDF (only flu vaccine misses — it's in FHIR but not the PDF). |
| 2026-05-03 | **N** | Closed upload→harmonize loop in the app | DataAggregator gets a "Harmonize N uploads" CTA; HarmonizeView reads `?collection=<id>` to pre-select. End-to-end clinician flow: upload → click → extract → merged record. Each step one click. |
| 2026-05-03 | **M** | Document-agnostic collections + manual extract endpoint | Upload sessions auto-register as harmonize collections; `POST /api/harmonize/{id}/extract` runs multipass-fhir on uploaded PDFs. App is no longer hardcoded to blake-real. End-to-end fake-upload smoke test passes with zero code changes. |
| 2026-05-03 | **L** | Harmonization layer wired into FastAPI + React app | `/aggregate/harmonize` ships in the production app. 350 merged Observations / 65 cross-source · 19 Conditions / 3 cross-source against `blake-real` collection (Cedars FHIR + Cedars PDF + 3 Function Health PDFs) |
| 2026-05-03 | **K** | Conditions merge in `lib/harmonize/` | SNOMED → ICD-10 → ICD-9 → name-bridge identity resolution. Code-promotion across sources. 11 tests green; merges Cedars FHIR (28 SNOMED-coded) + Cedars PDF (7 text-only) Conditions via display-text bridge. |
| 2026-05-03 | **J** | Harmonization layer v1 (Observations) | `lib/harmonize/` ships: LOINC + name-bridge matcher, unit normalization (mg/dL ⇄ mmol/L), FHIR Provenance minter. 17 tests; smoke run on Cedars + Function Health → 251 merged facts, 33 cross-source merges, 0 conflicts. **HDL trajectory 81→67 mg/dL** visible across sources for the first time. |
| 2026-05-03 | **H** | Conditions prompt v3 + GT dedup | F1 **0.67 → 0.70**; 4 condition "FPs" classified as **vision wins** (clinical findings in PDF that Cedars FHIR never coded) |
| 2026-05-03 | **I** | Lab "FPs" diagnostic | 41/41 are correctly-extracted IgE allergen panel; matching issue (GT display="class"), not pipeline error |
| 2026-05-03 | **F** | Page chunking for long PDFs | Gemma-tabular F1 0.55, 352s; 12 pts below all-Claude, 3.7× slower. Decision: keep all-Claude as default |
| 2026-05-03 | **D** | Findable-in-PDF GT filter | F1 0.64 → 0.67. Resolves the recall ceiling (9 of 28 GT conditions aren't in PDF) |
| 2026-05-03 | **C** | Multipass vs baseline across all PDFs | Lab-only PDFs: no improvement. Chart PDFs (Cedars, H&P, discharge): +15-153 facts. Routing opportunity. |
| 2026-05-03 | **B** | Gemma-tabular variant | First HTTP 400 on long PDFs; works on small (3-page rhett759). Led to Move F chunking work |
| 2026-05-03 | **A** | Conditions prompt v1 → v2 | F1 unchanged; surfaced recall-ceiling ambiguity → Move D |
| 2026-05-03 | K.4 | First bake-off (multipass vs single-pass) | F1 **0.03 → 0.64** (21× improvement). Schema-direct multipass validated. |

Pipeline framework + eval harness shipped 2026-05-03 (commits: pipeline Protocol + registry + bake-off + Streamlit Pipeline Bakeoff page).

## 2026-05-03 · Move T — empty-state + loading UI on the harmonize page

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Three render branches at the top of the harmonize page handle every collection-registry state cleanly: (1) loading — spinner + "Loading collections…" while the query is in flight; (2) empty — centered card explaining what's missing and offering Upload-Documents + Synthea-quick-start CTAs; (3) populated — existing behavior with picker / sources / tabs / footer.

**Why:** Until Move S, the empty-collections state was unreachable — `blake-real` was hardcoded into the registry so the page always had at least one collection. After Move S, blake-real registers conditionally; on a fresh checkout where someone has neither private Cedars data nor the public Synthea bundle, zero collections register and the page would render an empty `<select>` plus broken downstream queries. Empty state needed a graceful render path.

**How:** A conditional + Fragment wraps the populated-state JSX so the picker / sources panel / tabs / footer don't render when there's nothing to show. The empty-state card uses an Inbox icon in a soft-blue circle, two paragraphs of copy explaining the situation, and two CTAs (in-app upload route + external Synthea repo). Loading state is just a single line with the existing Loader2 spinner — no commitment to a content shape until the query resolves.

Caught a JSX parse error during the build: the conditional opened with `(` but the multi-block content inside needed a Fragment wrapper. TypeScript silently accepted it but Vite's parser rejected. Fixed by changing `(` to `(<>` and the existing closing `</>)}` matched up correctly.

**Result:**

The fresh-clone demo loop now has graceful degradation at every step. A reviewer who:

- Has the Synthea bundle: sees `synthea-demo` collection auto-loaded.
- Has Blake's data: sees `blake-real` collection alongside.
- Has neither: sees the empty-state card with clear next steps.
- Is mid-load: sees the spinner card.

TypeScript compiles. Vite serves the page at HTTP 200 with the new structure. 151 tests still green; no API surface changed.

**Conclusion:** The harmonize wedge demo is now polished end-to-end across every entry-point state. The `data-agnostic` framing the user pushed back on early in the project is now genuinely true: any reviewer, regardless of what data they have local, gets a coherent first-load experience.

**Next:**
- Async extract: still synchronous; bigger PDFs block 60–90s. Background task + polling endpoint.
- Pairwise source diff: "what does A have that B doesn't" rather than "what does A have that nobody else has."
- Mobile / tablet responsive pass — current layouts are desktop-tuned.

## 2026-05-03 · Move S — self-bootstrapping Synthea demo collection

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Fresh-clone reviewers can now experience the harmonize workflow without any private data. A `synthea-demo` collection auto-registers from the public Synthea bundle shipped with the repo and produces realistic cross-source merges. `blake-real` registration is now conditional on its source files being present locally so a fresh clone doesn't see an empty placeholder collection.

**Why:** Move N closed the upload→harmonize loop and Move M made the registry document-agnostic, but a reviewer who clones the repo cleanly has zero uploads and no Cedars / Function Health data. The first impression of the Atlas wedge would have been an empty collection picker. The demo flow needs to "just work" on day-1 of a checkout.

**How:** A real two-source dataset doesn't exist in the public corpus, so we synthesize one by splitting a single Synthea patient bundle along a temporal cutoff:

1. Pick `Adria871_Ankunding277_…` — diverse USCDI coverage (12 conditions, 10 meds, 11 immunizations, 100 obs).
2. Split at `2018-01-01`. Persistent identity resources (Patient, Practitioner, Organization, CareTeam) go to **both** snapshots.
3. **Conditions** are chronic state — onset before the cutoff appears in BOTH (chronic carry-forward); after the cutoff only in the late snapshot.
4. **Active MedicationRequests** authored before the cutoff appear in both (carried prescription).
5. Everything else splits on the first-available date.

The output is cached under `data/harmonize-demo/synthea-demo/` with mtime invalidation against the source bundle. Cache files are gitignored — the demo is fully regenerable from the repo's public Synthea data.

**Result:** Live numbers on `synthea-demo`:

```
source                       unique   shared
  EHR snapshot · 2018          25        18
  EHR snapshot · 2024          23        18
```

9 conditions, **8 of 9 cross-source merged.** The merged conditions are realistic chronic states (Chronic sinusitis, BMI 30+ obesity, Acute viral pharyngitis, etc.) — not just "same string" but actual same-fact-different-snapshots semantics. 38 observations, 10 cross-source merged (recurring vitals). Medications and immunizations don't cross-merge because Synthea models stopped→active transitions as new MedicationRequest IDs and immunizations are per-event, which is the right clinical behavior.

2 new tests — collection self-bootstraps + cross-source conditions exist. 151 tests total. blake-real now disappears from a fresh checkout's collection list since its private files aren't present, leaving synthea-demo as the only registered collection.

**Conclusion:** The Atlas harmonize wedge is now fully self-contained — a reviewer can clone the repo, `npm run dev`, navigate to `/aggregate/harmonize`, and experience the cross-source merge / Provenance lineage / unique-vs-shared diff against a synthetic-but-realistic dataset before ever uploading anything of their own.

**Next:**
- Async extract: still synchronous; bigger PDFs block 60–90s. Background task + polling endpoint.
- Pairwise source diff: "what does A have that B doesn't" rather than just "what does A have that nobody else has."
- Empty-state copy on the React page when zero collections register (hasn't been seen since blake-real was hardcoded — it's an actual reachable state now).

## 2026-05-03 · Move R — multi-source contribution diff (vision wins surface automatically)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Per-source partitioning of merged facts into *unique* (only this source contributed) vs *shared* (this source plus at least one other contributed). New `GET /api/harmonize/{id}/source-diff` endpoint; new Unique / Shared / Total-raw columns in the React Sources panel; new "Unique only" toggle on the contribution drill-down.

**Why:** The bidirectional Provenance walk (Move Q) answered "what did each source contribute total?" That conflates two very different signals. A source that adds 50 facts none of which any other source has is a *unique-data* source. A source that adds the *same* 50 facts another source has is a *cross-source confirmation* source. Both are useful — but they're useful in different ways, and a flat contribution count hides which is which.

**How:** For each source label, walk all five merged-record lists; a record is *unique to S* iff `len({s.source_label for s in record.sources}) == 1` and that one label is `S`. Otherwise it's shared with whoever else contributed. The implementation is a fan-out over the same merged-record arrays the contribution endpoint already computes — no new graph, just a different query.

**Result:** Live numbers on `blake-real`:

```
source                       unique   shared
  Cedars-Sinai (FHIR)         156       51
  Cedars-Sinai (PDF)          103       57
  Function Health · 2024-07-26   24        0
  Function Health · 2024-07-29   21       65
  Function Health · 2025-11-29    0       58
```

The first headline finding: **the 4 Cedars PDF unique conditions are exactly the vision wins from Move H** (Bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy, Bipartite tibial sesamoid, Chronic 2nd-toe fracture, Marginal osteophyte at left 1st MTP joint) — clinical findings the structured Cedars FHIR pull never coded. In Move H I identified these by manually triaging the 4 condition "FPs" against the GT. Move R surfaces them automatically as the diff between PDF and FHIR. The vision-wins concept goes from "audit-time discovery" to "runtime UI element."

The second finding: **Function Health · 2025-11-29 has 0 unique, 58 shared.** Every lab in that draw is also somewhere else (Cedars FHIR + earlier Function Health). Removing it would lose nothing, but would lose 58 cross-source confirmations. That's a different argument for keeping it than "this source carries unique data" — and the UI now distinguishes the two cases explicitly with an amber callout.

3 new API tests; 149 tests total. TypeScript clean. Vision wins now surface in production UI without any per-fact prompting or manual triage.

**Conclusion:** Two passes over the Provenance graph — the per-fact lineage walk (Move L), the per-source contribution walk (Move Q), and now the per-source unique-vs-shared partition (Move R) — answer the three core clinician questions about source value: *where did this fact come from*, *what did this source give us*, and *what would I lose by removing it*.

**Next:**
- Async extract: still synchronous; 60–90s blocks the React mutation. Background task + polling.
- Synthetic Synthea demo collection so a fresh-clone reviewer has something pre-staged.
- Pairwise source diff: "what does Source A have that Source B doesn't" — symmetric difference between two specific sources, not just one-vs-all-others. Becomes useful once you have ≥3 sources contributing the same resource type.

## 2026-05-03 · Move Q — bidirectional Provenance walk

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** The Provenance graph supports walking in both directions now. The fact → sources direction was already shipped (per-merged-record lineage panel, Move L). This adds the source → facts direction: from any DocumentReference in a collection, list every merged record across every resource type that has a source pointing back at that document.

**Why:** The two directions answer different clinician questions. Per-fact lineage answers "where did this lab value come from?" — useful when auditing one number. Per-source contribution answers "what did this source PDF actually give us?" — useful for evaluating source quality before deciding whether to keep or remove a source, or to compare information density across sources. It's also the most viscerally demonstrable Atlas-wedge feature for a Phase 1 reviewer: click a source row, see the Provenance graph fan out into 200 facts.

**How:** `facts_for_document_reference()` walks all five merged-record lists (Observations / Conditions / Medications / Allergies / Immunizations), filters to records whose `sources[].document_reference` matches, and returns serialized payloads grouped by resource type with per-type and total counts. The serializers were already in place from earlier moves; the walk is just a fan-out filter. No data structure changes — `MergedX.sources[].document_reference` was always there, just not queried in this direction.

API: new `GET /api/harmonize/{id}/contributions/{document_reference:path}` (path-typed param so the slash in `DocumentReference/cedars-...` doesn't break routing).

React: Sources panel rows are now clickable. Click → inline ContributionsPanel expands underneath the table with five stat tiles + four list cards (Conditions / Medications / Immunizations / Allergies showing canonical names) + a footer line for the Lab count (too dense to list inline).

**Result:** Live numbers on `blake-real`:

| Source | Obs | Cond | Med | All | Imm | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cedars-Sinai (FHIR) | 174 | 15 | 7 | 1 | 10 | **207** |
| Cedars-Sinai (PDF)  | 138 | 7  | 6 | 1 | 8  | **160** |

The asymmetry is informative: the FHIR pull contributes 47 more facts than the PDF, mostly in Observations (174 vs 138 — Cedars FHIR carries vitals + anthropometrics that the PDF summary doesn't include). For Conditions the PDF hits 7 vs FHIR 15 — Conditions are encounter-coded in FHIR (multiple instances per code) but appear once-each in the PDF summary, so pre-dedup that gap is bigger than it looks.

2 new API tests; 146 tests green total. TypeScript clean.

**Conclusion:** The Atlas Provenance graph is now bidirectional in production, which closes the design loop on the wedge described in `ATLAS-DATA-MODEL.md`. Every fact knows where it came from; every source knows what it contributed.

**Next:**
- Async extract: still synchronous `POST /extract`. Background task with polling endpoint is the obvious upgrade.
- Multi-source contribution diff: "what does the PDF add that FHIR doesn't?" — symmetric difference between two source contribution sets. The vision-wins from Move H are this concept; productizing it would let a clinician sort sources by *unique* contribution rather than total contribution.
- Synthetic Synthea demo collection so a fresh-clone reviewer has something pre-staged.

## 2026-05-03 · Move P — Allergies + Immunizations matchers (USCDI clinical core complete)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Fourth and fifth resource types ported into the harmonization layer. With Observations + Conditions + Medications already shipped, this completes the USCDI v3 clinical-summary core in the harmonized record.

**Why:** USCDI is the FHIR-shaped MVP for "what a clinician expects in a patient summary" — labs, problems, meds, allergies, immunizations. Each missing resource type would have been a visible gap in the demo. Two more matchers, both mechanical, knocks both gaps out at once.

**How:** Allergies follow the Conditions shape almost exactly (SNOMED → RxNorm → name → name-bridge). Immunizations need a different identity model — they're *events*, not chronic state, so the match key is `(vaccine_code, occurrence_date)` rather than just `vaccine_code`. Two flu shots in different years stay as two separate events; a flu shot recorded by both Cedars FHIR and the extracted PDF on the same day collapses onto one merged event.

The immunization name-bridge fallback handles the case where PDF text-only records arrive after a CVX-keyed record has already been built for the same date and matching display.

**Result:** Live numbers on `blake-real` (Cedars FHIR + Cedars HealthSummary PDF):

| | FHIR | PDF | merged | cross-source |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Allergies | 1 | 1 | **1** | **1** |
| Immunizations | 10 | 8 | **10** | **8** |

The 2 single-source immunizations are the COVID-19 Pfizer 2021 doses (in FHIR, not in the PDF — the PDF dataset starts at the 2023 booster). Every other shot — 5 flu vaccines, both MMR doses, the 2023 COVID booster, and the Tdap — merges cleanly via CVX + date.

13 unit tests (4 allergies + 9 immunizations) + 2 API tests; 144 tests total now. TypeScript clean. The React HarmonizeView grew from 3 to 5 tabs in one commit.

**Conclusion:** The pattern proves out for every USCDI core resource type: same matcher shape, swap the identity-priority list. Resource-type-specific design only matters when the *lifecycle* differs (Immunizations as events vs chronic-state for everything else); coding-system priorities are otherwise straight enumeration.

**Next:**
- Async extract: `POST /extract` is still synchronous; 60–90s blocks the React mutation. Background task + polling endpoint.
- Bidirectional Provenance walk: from a DocumentReference, list every fact derived from it. Useful as a "what did this PDF actually contribute?" panel.
- Multi-patient demo: collection registry currently has one demo + dynamic upload-derived. A reviewer who clones fresh has only the upload path. Consider a synthetic-Synthea demo collection for the empty-state experience.

## 2026-05-03 · Move O — Medications matcher + Medications tab

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Third resource type ported into the harmonization layer. New `lib/harmonize/medications.py` matches MedicationRequests across sources via RxNorm code overlap → drug-name canonicalization → drug-name bridge → passthrough. New `MergedMedication` model. New `/api/harmonize/{id}/medications` endpoint. New "Medications" tab in the React HarmonizeView.

**Why:** Labs + Conditions cover the structural / observational story; medications cover the *interventions* — and they're the resource type a clinician most often needs to reconcile across sources (refills, dose changes, prescribed-vs-taking divergence). The same matcher shape generalizes cleanly: only the identity-priority list changes per resource type.

**How:** Three implementation details worth noting:

1. **Reference resolution.** Cedars MedicationRequests don't carry codings inline; they reference a contained `Medication` resource via `medicationReference`. The matcher pulls the Medication out of the same SourceBundle and reads its `code.coding` array. The `harmonize_service.merged_medications()` is responsible for handing both `MedicationRequest` and `Medication` resources into each bundle.
2. **RxNorm code unions.** Cedars stamps 5–20 RxNorm codes on the contained Medication (one per generic / strength / formulation variant). The matcher unions them and uses an `rxnorm_to_key` index so a later source whose RxNorm set overlaps via *any* code finds the existing merged record. Without the index, two sources whose primary keys differ but whose code sets overlap would create duplicate records.
3. **Drug-name canonicalization.** `canonical_drug_name()` strips brand-name parentheticals and the dose/formulation tail. "fluticasone propionate (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray" → "fluticasone propionate". This catches the case where Cedars FHIR has the generic display and the PDF has the brand-parenthetical display — they both canonicalize to the same key.

**Result:**

Live numbers on `blake-real` (Cedars FHIR + Cedars HealthSummary PDF):

| | FHIR | PDF | merged | cross-source |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MedicationRequests | 7 | 6 | **7** | **6** |

The 6 cross-source merges are azelastine, cetirizine, epinephrine, fluticasone propionate, loratadine, methylprednisolone — every prescription drug present in both sources. The single non-merge is the influenza vaccine (FHIR-only). RxNorm code unions per merged record run 8–22 codes (e.g. azelastine: 9 codes, fluticasone propionate: 22 codes).

12 unit tests + 1 API test, all green. Total project tests: 132. TypeScript compiles clean.

**Conclusion:** Pattern proven across three resource types now. Allergies + Immunizations are mechanical follow-ups — same matcher shape with their own identity-priority lists (e.g. SNOMED for allergies, CVX + date proximity for immunizations).

**Next:**
- Allergies + Immunizations matchers (~30 min each, additive).
- Async extract: `POST /extract` is still synchronous; 60–90s blocks. Background task with polling endpoint.
- Bidirectional Provenance walk: from a DocumentReference, list every fact derived from it.

## 2026-05-03 · Move N — closed upload→harmonize loop in the app

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Wired the existing Data Aggregator upload UI into the Harmonize page so the clinician flow is one continuous path. Two narrow changes: a "Harmonize N uploads" CTA button that appears in the Submitted Files header when uploads exist, linking to `/aggregate/harmonize?collection=upload-<patientId>`; and `?collection=` URL-param honoring on the harmonize page so the linked-to collection is pre-selected on arrival.

**Why:** Move M made the app document-agnostic at the API layer but left the user flow split — uploads land on `/aggregate/sources`, harmonize lives at `/aggregate/harmonize`, and there was no bridge. A clinician would have had to know the collection-id naming convention (`upload-<patient_id>`) and type it into the picker. That's the kind of seam reviewers notice in a 5-minute demo.

**How:** The `?collection=<id>` sync uses a `hasSyncedFromUrl` flag so it runs exactly once on first render — picker changes after that aren't overwritten. The button only renders when `sources.uploaded_files.length > 0`, so the affordance is invisible until it's useful.

**Result:** Three click flow ships:

```
1. /aggregate/sources           → upload PDF / FHIR JSON
2. click "Harmonize N uploads"  → /aggregate/harmonize?collection=upload-...
3. click "Extract uploaded PDFs" (if PDFs present) → merged record renders
```

TypeScript clean; 120 tests pass; Vite serves the updated HarmonizeView with `useSearchParams` resolved.

**Conclusion:** The harmonize layer is now demoable as a real workflow, not just a debug surface. Anyone can land on the Data Aggregator with no Blake-specific data, upload their own documents, and watch the merged record assemble.

**Next:**
- Async extract: 90s synchronous extract calls in the route handler aren't great — the React mutation just hangs while a PDF is processing. Should move to a background task with a polling endpoint, or at least surface a real progress indicator.
- Bidirectional Provenance walk: from a DocumentReference, list every fact derived from it. New card on the fact-detail panel.
- Medications + Allergies + Immunizations matchers — same shape as Observations/Conditions, mostly mechanical.

## 2026-05-03 · Move M — document-agnostic collections + manual extract endpoint

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** The harmonize collection registry stops being a static dict. Any subdirectory under `data/aggregation-uploads/<session>/` now becomes a harmonize collection automatically. Plus a `POST /api/harmonize/{collection_id}/extract` endpoint runs the multipass-fhir pipeline on every uploaded PDF that lacks a cached extraction; the React surface shows an "Extract uploaded PDFs" button when an upload-derived collection is selected.

**Why:** Move L wired harmonize into the React app but left one collection (`blake-real`) hardcoded. The user's framing was "the application should be agnostic if it's my documents or other documents" — meaning anyone uploads documents and the merged record renders without code changes. This move closes that gap.

**How:** Three changes:

1. `_discover_upload_collections()` in `api/core/harmonize_service.py` scans `UPLOADS_ROOT` (env-overridable for tests). Each subdir becomes a `CollectionDefinition` with id `upload-<session>`. PDF files become `extracted-pdf` sources whose extracted JSON lives at `<basename>.extracted.json` next to them; FHIR-shaped JSON files (cheap structural check: contains `"resourceType"` / `"fhir"` / `"providers"`) become `fhir-pull` sources directly.
2. `extract_pending_pdfs()` runs `multipass-fhir.extract()` on every PDF lacking a cached extraction, writes the bundle next to the PDF, busts the source-load cache. 400s for static demo collections.
3. React: extract mutation with React Query, invalidates sources/observations/conditions on success so tables refresh automatically. Pending state with spinner; success state surfaces per-PDF entry-count + elapsed time.

**Result:**

End-to-end smoke run with a freshly-staged upload session under `/tmp/harm-int/upload-test-1/labs.json`:

```
=== list collections ===
  blake-real:           5 sources — Blake Thomson — real EHI exports
  upload-upload-test-1: 1 sources — Uploaded session · upload-test-1

=== upload session sources ===
  labs.json (fhir-pull) avail=True obs=2

=== upload session observations ===
  total=2 cross=0
  HDL Cholesterol [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma (LOINC 2085-9) — latest 81.0 mg/dL
  Hemoglobin A1c/Hemoglobin.total in Blood (LOINC 4548-4)        — latest 5.4 %
```

The new collection appears in the listing, its FHIR JSON is parsed, observations resolve through the LOINC bridge — all without writing any new code per upload.

4 new tests in `UploadCollectionDiscoveryTests` use a tempdir override + `_cached_load.cache_clear()` to verify discovery, kind classification, and the static-collection guard on extract. 12 API tests now pass total.

**Conclusion:** The application is genuinely document-agnostic. The remaining gap to a clean demo is wiring the existing `POST /api/aggregation/uploads/{patient_id}` upload flow into a React UI affordance that lands files in the right directory under `aggregation-uploads/`. Today this is staged manually; the upload UI in DataAggregator.tsx already exists but doesn't redirect users to `/aggregate/harmonize` when uploads complete.

**Next:**
- Wire DataAggregator upload-success handler to navigate to `/aggregate/harmonize` with the new collection auto-selected.
- Async extract: 90s synchronous calls in the route handler aren't great. Move extraction to a background task or job queue so the React page can poll for completion.
- Bidirectional Provenance walk: from a DocumentReference, list every fact derived from it. Useful when the user wants to know "what did this PDF actually contribute?"
- Medications + Allergies + Immunizations matchers — same shape as Observations/Conditions, mostly mechanical.

## 2026-05-03 · Move L — harmonization layer wired into FastAPI + React app

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Harmonization graduates from the Streamlit prototype into the production app surface. New FastAPI router (`api/routers/harmonize.py`) exposes five collection-scoped endpoints; new React module (`app/src/pages/Modules/HarmonizeView.tsx`) renders sources panel + tabbed Labs/Conditions tables + per-fact Provenance graph at `/aggregate/harmonize`.

**Why:** The Streamlit page is fast for prototyping but invisible to reviewers. Harmonization is the strategic Atlas wedge — described in `ATLAS-DATA-MODEL.md` since the start but with no live application surface. Phase 1 demands a demo path inside the React app the reviewer actually opens.

**How:** Built three layers:

1. `api/core/harmonize_service.py` — collection registry + source loader (mtime-cached) + serialization helpers. One demo collection registered: `blake-real`, 5 sources (Cedars FHIR + Cedars HealthSummary PDF + 3 Function Health PDFs). The registry is open — future collections will be created when the upload flow materializes new source bundles.
2. `api/routers/harmonize.py` — `GET /collections`, `GET /{id}/sources`, `GET /{id}/observations[?cross_source_only]`, `GET /{id}/conditions[?cross_source_only]`, `GET /{id}/provenance/{merged_ref}`. Pydantic response models in `api/models.py`.
3. `app/src/pages/Modules/HarmonizeView.tsx` (~620 lines, Miro-styled) — React Query against the new endpoints, cross-source-only toggle, fact-row click → detail card + Provenance lineage panel + raw FHIR Provenance JSON expander.

**Result:** Live numbers on `blake-real`:

| | Observations | Conditions |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total canonical facts | **350** | **19** |
| Cross-source merges | **65** | **3** |
| Sources contributing | 5 | 2 |

8 API tests in `api/tests/test_harmonize_api.py` (all green). TypeScript compiles clean. Vite serves `/aggregate/harmonize` at HTTP 200, no compile errors.

The route sits naturally between `/aggregate/cleaning` and `/aggregate/publish` in the existing Data Aggregator workflow, so the harmonization step appears in the same flow as document upload.

**Conclusion:** Harmonize is now demoable inside the app. The reviewer opens the URL, picks the `blake-real` collection, sees the merged Observations table, clicks HDL Cholesterol, watches the longitudinal trajectory + Provenance panel populate.

**Next:**
- Wire upload-flow → new collection creation (right now there's only `blake-real` baked in; uploads should produce new collections).
- Conflict UI: when `has_conflict` fires, surface the per-source values + delta breakdown prominently. Currently the React page just shows a triangle icon.
- Bidirectional Provenance walk: from a DocumentReference, list every fact derived from it. One query, new card on the fact-detail panel.
- Medications + Allergies + Immunizations follow the same matcher shape — port them.

## 2026-05-03 · Move K — Conditions merge in `lib/harmonize/`

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Extended the harmonization layer from Observations-only to Conditions, mirroring the matcher architecture. New `lib/harmonize/conditions.py` + `MergedCondition`/`ConditionSource` models. Identity strategies: SNOMED → ICD-10 → ICD-9 → normalized-name. Adds a name-bridge fallback: when a Condition has no codes (typical of vision-extracted PDFs) and its display text matches an already-merged coded Condition, attach onto that record (`activity = name-bridge`) rather than create a duplicate text-keyed record.

**Why:** Cedars FHIR Conditions are triple-coded (SNOMED + ICD-9 + ICD-10) but the same Conditions extracted from the matching Cedars HealthSummary PDF arrive as text-only. Without the bridge, all 7 PDF Conditions ended up in a separate name-keyspace from the 28 FHIR Conditions and no cross-source merges happened.

**How:** Smoke run against Blake's two Cedars sources after each iteration. Wrote 11 unit tests covering SNOMED/ICD/name match, code-promotion (later sources fill in missing codes), `is_active` rollup, and Provenance minting on Conditions.

**Result:**

| | First impl (no bridge) | With name-bridge |
|---|---:|---:|
| Cedars FHIR Conditions in | 28 | 28 |
| Cedars PDF Conditions in | 7 | 7 |
| Cross-source merges | **0** | **3** |

The 3 cross-source merges are: *Allergic rhinitis due to American house dust mite*, *Non-seasonal allergic rhinitis due to pollen*, and *Sinus congestion* — each retains the full triple-coded SNOMED/ICD-10/ICD-9 from the FHIR source plus a `name-bridge` edge from the PDF source.

**Conclusion:** Display-text bridge is the right pragmatic call for v1. A SNOMED ↔ ICD-10 cross-walk via UMLS would be more rigorous but far higher-effort, and most US clinical sources emit both code systems side-by-side anyway, so the gap that bridge would fill is rare in practice.

**Next:**
- Bridge tightening: today the bridge only fires on identical normalized text. Fuzzy-match (Levenshtein, embedding similarity) would catch synonyms like "Hyperlipidemia" vs "High cholesterol" — but introduces false-positive risk worth measuring before shipping.
- Code-system promotion is one-way (later sources add missing codes; earlier sources can't be retroactively updated). Two-pass matching would make this symmetric. Likely worth doing if/when ingestion grows beyond two sources.

---

## 2026-05-03 · Move J — harmonization layer v1 (Observations)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** First vertical slice of the harmonization layer. New `lib/harmonize/` package with: `observations.py` (matcher), `loinc_bridge.py` (hand-curated ~50-lab name→LOINC table), `units.py` (LOINC-aware mg/dL ⇄ mmol/L conversion with cholesterol vs glucose factor disambiguation), `provenance.py` (FHIR Provenance minter using Atlas-canonical Extension URLs), `models.py` (`MergedObservation`, `ObservationSource`, `ProvenanceEdge`).

**Why:** Atlas's defensible wedge has always been multi-source merge with the Provenance graph (`ATLAS-DATA-MODEL.md`). The 5-layer scaffold from earlier in the project was archived because it predated a working ingestion path; now that PDF→FHIR reaches measurable F1, the next-priority layer is the merge that turns N source bundles into one canonical record.

**How:** Three identity strategies in priority order:

1. **LOINC code match** — both sources share a LOINC code.
2. **Name-bridge lookup** — one source has only a free-text label; the bridge resolves to LOINC.
3. **Normalized-name passthrough** — neither source has LOINC; merge by normalized name string.

Same-day cross-source >10% spread flags `has_conflict`. Longitudinal change does not. Unit conversion fires when source unit ≠ canonical unit; conversion factor pulled from a LOINC-aware table (Glucose 18.0156 vs Cholesterol 38.67 for the same `mmol/L → mg/dL` pair).

**Result:** 17 tests; smoke run on Blake's Cedars (234 Observations, 2025-11-07) + Function Health (169 Observations across 3 PDFs, 2024-07–2025-11):

- 251 canonical facts merged from 403 source observations.
- 33 cross-source merges.
- 0 conflicts (no same-day disagreement >10%).

The clinical signal: HDL Cholesterol **dropped 81 → 67 mg/dL over 16 months**, Triglycerides doubled 70 → 147 mg/dL, A1C drift 5.4 → 5.1 → 5.2%. None of these trajectories are visible in any single source.

Worked example written up at `docs/architecture/HARMONIZATION-WORKED-EXAMPLE.md`.

**Conclusion:** Vertical slice strategy validated. Going deep on Observations first (rather than broad-but-shallow across all resource types) produced a demo-able artifact in one iteration. Conditions/Medications/Allergies follow the same shape and become mechanical.

**Next:** Move K (Conditions merge), then Move L (wire into the FastAPI + React app).

---

## 2026-05-03 · Move H — conditions prompt v3 + GT dedup + vision-wins finding

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Wrote conditions prompt v3 with explicit ICD-code-family enumeration (Z-codes for screening/encounters, R-codes for symptoms-as-conditions, S-codes for injuries, D-codes for neoplasms). Added concrete example codes for each. Plus added GT deduplication to the eval (`dedupe_gt_facts()`) — Cedars FHIR emits a separate Condition resource per encounter, so the same code repeated across 4 visits was inflating GT count.

**Why:** Move A v2 (less specific) had condition recall stuck at 0.16. Diagnostic dump revealed the 16 missed-but-findable conditions clustered around Z/R/S code families the model wasn't pulling.

**How:** `multipass-fhir × cedars-health-summary`, conditions prompt at v3 (other passes unchanged), `findable_only=True`, `dedupe_gt=True`.

**Result:**

| metric | v2 | v3 | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Overall weighted F1** | **0.67** | **0.70** | **+3 pts** |
| Conditions extracted | 5 | 7 | +2 |
| Conditions GT (deduped + findable) | 19 (raw findable) | 10 (deduped findable) | -9 (real fairness) |
| Conditions TP | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| Conditions FP | 2 | 4 | +2 |
| Conditions recall | 0.16 | 0.30 | +14 pts |
| Conditions F1 | 0.27 | 0.35 | +8 pts |

The condition recall headline (0.16 → 0.30) is mostly GT dedup, not v3 prompt. v3 added 2 new emissions; both went into the FP bucket. **But inspecting the FPs revealed the actual story — they're vision wins, not hallucinations.**

**The 4 condition FPs are all clinical findings in the PDF that Cedars FHIR never coded:**

  1. `'chronic appearing fracture at the base of the right 2nd toe proximal phalanx'` — X-ray report narrative
  2. `'bipartite tibial sesamoid on the left'` — imaging anatomical variant
  3. `'marginal osteophyte at the lateral left 1st mtp joint'` — bone spur
  4. `'bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy'` — ENT exam finding

These are real clinical facts in the PDF. Cedars represents them as narrative text (imaging reports, exam findings) but **never created Condition resources for them**. Vision extraction recovered them. The eval's "FP" classification is an artifact of using FHIR-only ground truth.

**Conclusion:**

1. **The Atlas wedge is now empirically demonstrated.** Vision extraction pulled 4 clinical facts the structured FHIR is missing. This is the cross-source-augmentation use case the architecture was designed for.
2. **Conditions recall improvement was 50% real, 50% GT-dedup-cosmetic.** The 7 still-missed conditions (Z-codes, R-codes, S-codes for sprains/fractures) suggest the model is biased toward narrative descriptions over coded encounter diagnoses. v4 might iterate further but diminishing returns set in.
3. **The eval's precision metric is misleading.** Calling vision wins "false positives" punishes the pipeline for doing the right thing. Future eval upgrade: a "vision-wins reviewer" surface that lets a human classify each FP as `valid_extra` vs `hallucination`.
4. **GT deduplication was a real fairness improvement.** Without it, recall was bounded by Cedars's encounter-multiplicity. Should ship by default for all future runs.

**Decisions:**

- **Conditions stays at v3.** Modest gain over v2 but enables vision-wins extraction.
- **`dedupe_gt=True` is the new eval default.**
- **Future: "vision-wins reviewer"** Streamlit page or notebook cell — let a human triage condition/lab "FPs" into valid-extras vs hallucinations.

**Next:**

- ⏳ Move I follow-up: the lab "FPs" deserve the same diagnostic.
- ⏳ Conditions v4: target the 7 still-missed Z/R/S-codes specifically.
- ⏳ Vision-wins reviewer surface.

## 2026-05-03 · Move I — lab "FPs" diagnostic: matching issue, not hallucination

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Dumped the 41 lab false-positives from the multipass-fhir × Cedars run. Goal was to classify them as vision wins vs hallucinations to inform a v2 lab prompt.

**Why:** Lab F1 stuck at 0.70 (precision 0.71, recall 0.69). Reducing 40 FPs through prompt tightening would push F1 toward 0.85.

**Result — finding flipped the framing:**

All 41 lab "FPs" are an **IgE allergen panel** extracted with proper allergen names:
- "egg white (f001) ige class"
- "peanut (f013) ige class"
- "walnut (f256) ige class"
- "milk, cow's (f02) ige class"
- "shrimp (f024) ige class"
- "d pteronyssinus (d001) ige class"
- "aspergillus fumigatus (m003) ige class"
- … 34 more

The GT has these same labs but coded as `loinc:102136-9 'class'` / `loinc:102639-2 'class'` / etc. — the GT `code.text` is just `"class"` with no allergen identifier, plus a LOINC code per allergen.

**The labs are correctly extracted.** The matcher can't link them because:
- Code match fails (model emitted no LOINC; GT has LOINC but the model couldn't read it from the PDF)
- Display match fails (GT display = "class"; model display = "egg white (f001) ige class" — token overlap with "class" alone is too low)

**Conclusion:**

1. **These are not hallucinations.** They are correctly-extracted allergen-panel results that fail to match against poorly-displayed GT entries.
2. **No prompt change can fix this** — the LOINC codes for individual IgE allergens (Egg White IgE = LOINC 6075-6, Peanut IgE = LOINC 6206-7, etc.) are not printed in the PDF; they're inferred from the test panel by the lab system at coding time.
3. **The fix is matcher-side or eval-side**, not pipeline-side:
   - Option A: Add a known LOINC mapping table for common allergens — when the model emits "egg white ige" mark it as matching `loinc:6075-6`. Brittle.
   - Option B: For labs with `code.text="class"` in GT, surface this in the eval as "low-quality GT display, manual review required."
   - Option C: Mark these as vision wins (same as Move H's 4 condition FPs) and accept that lab precision is conservative for this Cedars data quality issue.

**Decision:** No code change today. Document the finding; lab F1 0.70 is as good as the matcher can score on this PDF given the GT's display-quality. Re-evaluate when we have ground truth from a different source (Function Health labs would have proper LOINC codes printed).

**Next:**

- ⏳ Add a Streamlit "vision-wins reviewer" page that lets a human triage condition/lab FPs.
- ⏳ When working with future PDFs that have ground truth, prefer GT sources where `code.text` has meaningful displays (Synthea, MIMIC).

## 2026-05-03 · Move F — page chunking unblocks Gemma-tabular on long PDFs

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Added page chunking to `GoogleAIStudioBackend` (default 8 pages per chunk). When a PDF exceeds the threshold, `extract()` splits the rasterized images into chunks, calls the API per chunk sequentially, merges responses with cross-chunk deduplication. Plus three follow-on fixes from real failures during the work: markdown-fence stripping (Gemma sometimes wraps JSON in `` ```json … ``` `` despite `responseMimeType=application/json`), code-based dedup signature in the merger (cross-chunk dups when the same medication appears on pages 4 and 12), and a urlopen timeout bump (180s → 600s, dense passes can legitimately take minutes).

**Why:** Move B failed on the 25-page Cedars PDF with `HTTP 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`. We needed Gemma to handle long documents to make per-pass cost optimization viable.

**How:** `multipass-fhir-gemma-tabular × cedars-health-summary`, 25-page PDF, 4 chunks per Gemma pass, 600s timeout, `findable_only=True`, all 5 passes ran (2 Claude + 3 Gemma + Pass 0).

**Result:**

| type | findable GT | extracted | TP | precision | recall | F1 | route |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| condition | 19 | 3 | 3 | 1.00 | 0.16 | 0.27 | Claude |
| medication | 7 | 7 | 6 | 0.86 | 0.86 | 0.86 | Gemma chunked |
| allergy | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Claude |
| immunization | 10 | 7 | 7 | 1.00 | 0.70 | 0.82 | Gemma chunked |
| lab | 143 | **55** | 55 | 1.00 | **0.38** | 0.56 | Gemma chunked |

**Overall F1: 0.55 weighted, 352s wall-clock.**

**Side-by-side vs all-Claude multipass:**

| metric | all-Claude | Gemma-tabular (chunked) | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| weighted F1 | **0.67** | 0.55 | **-12 pts** |
| latency | **95s** | 352s | **+3.7×** |
| est. cost / PDF | $0.30 | $0.12 | -60% |
| medications F1 | 0.92 | 0.86 | -6 |
| immunizations F1 | 0.89 | 0.82 | -7 |
| **labs F1** | **0.70** | **0.56** | **-14** |

**Conclusion:**

1. **Chunking works at the architecture level.** Long PDFs no longer fail with HTTP 400; medications and immunizations recover proper recall via chunked Gemma. The bugs caught along the way (fence stripping, dedup, timeout) are now fixed in the framework — they'd benefit any future chunking caller.
2. **Gemma-tabular is currently inferior on every dimension except cost.** Slower (3.7×), lower F1 (12 points), worse on the highest-volume task (labs F1 0.56 vs 0.70). Cost win is real but the latency penalty makes it unattractive for interactive workflows.
3. **The lab gap is the dominant story.** Gemma extracted 55 of 143 labs vs Claude's 138. Likely causes: (a) chunks miss the cross-page table-continuation context Claude sees in one shot; (b) Gemma is genuinely less aggressive at extracting all rows from dense tables; (c) cross-chunk overlap loses some rows.
4. **Real bugs caught.** The fence-stripper, the dedup signature, the urlopen timeout — all generic infrastructure improvements that benefit anyone using `GoogleAIStudioBackend` with long PDFs going forward.

**Decisions made:**

- **`multipass-fhir` (all-Claude) remains the default.** Gemma-tabular variant kept registered for cost-constrained workflows on small PDFs, with the `chunked-but-slow-and-lossier` caveat documented.
- **Don't pursue parallel chunk dispatch yet** — the latency penalty is real, but parallel chunks would still be slower than all-Claude on chart documents (rate limits, sequential per-pass) and the F1 gap suggests Gemma is the wrong tool for dense tables, not just chunking.
- **Real cost-optimization story** is probably "different model entirely" rather than "smaller model on subset of passes." Claude Haiku 4.5 might be a better experiment than Gemma 4 31B for the cost-constrained path.

**Next:**

- ⏳ Try `multipass-fhir-haiku` (Haiku 4.5 for tabular passes) — Anthropic's cheap tier likely outperforms Gemma 4 on document-density tasks.
- ⏳ Investigate why Gemma's lab recall is ~50% — does it skip rows? Does the chunked extraction miss tables that span a chunk boundary?
- ⏳ Conditions still at 0.16 recall with 16 findable misses. Real prompt-tuning room exists; on the backlog after we know what other architectures look like.

## 2026-05-03 · Move D — findable-in-PDF GT filter

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Added `filter_gt_to_findable_in_pdf()` to the eval module — extracts pdfplumber text from a PDF, filters ground-truth facts to those whose primary code or display tokens actually appear in the PDF text. Wired through `evaluate_bundle(pdf_path=, findable_only=)` and the bake-off harness's `findable_only` flag. Streamlit page now exposes the toggle (default ON).

**Why:** Move A surfaced a recall-ceiling ambiguity: the Cedars FHIR has 28 conditions but the 25-page Health Summary PDF is a snapshot, not the full chart. Without filtering, multipass-fhir's recall is bounded by *how much of the chart appears in the PDF*, not *how good the pipeline is at extracting from what's there*.

**How:** Three matching tests per fact (any one passes → findable):

  1. Any code in any terminology (ICD-10, SNOMED, RxNorm, LOINC, CVX) appears as a substring in PDF text
  2. Display name appears as case-insensitive substring
  3. ≥50% of display tokens appear in PDF token set

Anything that fails all three is unfindable. Scanned PDFs (no extractable text layer) default to all-findable.

**Result on Cedars Health Summary:**

| type | all GT | findable | unfindable |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| condition | 28 | **19** | **9** |
| medication | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| allergy | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| immunization | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| lab | 143 | 143 | 0 |
| **total** | **189** | **180** | **9** |

All 9 unfindables are conditions — exactly the historical conditions we suspected weren't in the snapshot:
- `D22.9` multiple nevi
- `L82.1` seborrheic keratoses
- `L81.9` post-inflammatory pigmentary changes
- `Z00.00` annual physical exam (×3 — three encounter records all coded the same way)
- `Z11.59` special screening examination for viral disease
- `E78.5` hyperlipidemia, unspecified

Re-scored multipass-fhir × cedars-health-summary with findable-only:

| type | gt(strict) | gt(findable) | TP | recall(strict) | recall(findable) | F1(strict) | F1(findable) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| condition | 28 | **19** | 3 | 0.11 | **0.16** | 0.18 | **0.27** |
| medication | 7 | 7 | 6 | 0.86 | 0.86 | 0.92 | 0.92 |
| allergy | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| immunization | 10 | 10 | 8 | 0.80 | 0.80 | 0.89 | 0.89 |
| lab | 143 | 143 | 98 | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.70 | 0.70 |

**Overall F1: 0.64 (strict) → 0.67 (findable).**

**Conclusion:**

1. **The recall ceiling was real but smaller than I estimated.** Only 9 of 28 conditions are unfindable; the other 19 are in the PDF and we missed 16 of them. So there *is* meaningful prompt-tuning room for conditions — we're not at the floor.
2. **All 16 still-missed conditions are in the PDF text.** Future prompt iterations can be measured against this filtered baseline. Worth a separate experiment.
3. **The filter caught exactly the kind of GT noise we expected** — historical/encounter-level conditions that don't make it into a Health Summary export. It did NOT filter out any medications/allergies/immunizations/labs, which makes sense (those have their own sections in the summary).
4. **The eval harness now has a meaningful signal-to-noise improvement.** Future experiments should use `findable_only=True` by default; legacy strict mode kept for cases where we want to measure GT-coverage gap.

**Next:**

- ⏳ Investigate the 16 still-missed-but-findable conditions. Likely candidates for the next conditions-prompt iteration.
- ⏳ The 40 lab false-positives still need triage — vision wins or hallucinations? Filterable similarly?
- ⏳ Move F next: page chunking on GoogleAIStudioBackend.

## 2026-05-03 · Move B — Gemma 4 31B for tabular passes on Cedars

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Built `MultiPassFHIRGemmaTabularPipeline` (registered as `multipass-fhir-gemma-tabular`). Same architecture as `multipass-fhir` but with per-pass overrides routing medications, immunizations, and lab observations to Gemma 4 31B. Conditions, allergies, and Pass 0 stay on Claude.

**Why:** Cost optimization per `PDF-PROCESSOR.md` Decision 4. Tabular passes (lab tables, med lists, vaccine schedules) play to Gemma's strengths and are 5–10× cheaper than Claude. If F1 holds, this becomes the new default.

**How:** First attempt failed with `pypdfium2` race condition on concurrent rasterization (3 Gemma passes opening the same byte buffer simultaneously). Fix: class-level `threading.Lock` on `GoogleAIStudioBackend._RASTERIZE_LOCK`. Second attempt failed with three `HTTP 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors from the Google AI Studio API on the 25-page Cedars PDF.

**Result:**

```
[multipass-fhir] pass 'medications'      failed: HTTP 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT
[multipass-fhir] pass 'immunizations'    failed: HTTP 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT
[multipass-fhir] pass 'lab_observations' failed: HTTP 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT
```

| type | gt | extracted | F1 | source |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| condition | 28 | 3 | 0.19 | Claude (worked) |
| allergy | 1 | 1 | 1.00 | Claude (worked) |
| medication | 7 | 0 | 0.00 | Gemma (FAILED) |
| immunization | 10 | 0 | 0.00 | Gemma (FAILED) |
| lab | 143 | 0 | 0.00 | Gemma (FAILED) |

Overall F1: **0.03** (only the Claude passes succeeded).

**Conclusion:**

1. **Gemma 4 31B via Google AI Studio API fails on long PDFs.** 25 pages × 150 DPI rasterized PNGs = ~5 MB of inline image data. The API rejects with INVALID_ARGUMENT — likely a per-request image-count limit (Google's docs say 20 MB inline-data limit but may have a separate parts-per-request constraint).
2. **The error message is generic** — "Request contains an invalid argument." doesn't tell us what's invalid. Need to try smaller PDFs to localize the constraint.
3. **The pypdfium2 concurrency bug was real and is now fixed.** Class-level `_RASTERIZE_LOCK` serializes the rasterization step across threads while leaving the API call (the slow part) parallel.
4. **Cost-optimization hypothesis still untested on Cedars.** Need either chunking or a smaller PDF to confirm whether tabular F1 holds when Gemma replaces Claude on tabular passes.

**Next:**

- ⏳ **Test Gemma-tabular variant on a smaller PDF** (rhett759, 3 pages, 17 facts) — confirms Gemma can handle the multi-pass structure when it's not constrained by image count.
- ⏳ **If Gemma works on small PDFs:** add page-chunking to GoogleAIStudioBackend so 25-page PDFs split into 5-page chunks per call.
- ⏳ **If Gemma fails on small PDFs too:** the issue is in the schema/prompt/structure, not page count — investigate the request payload.
- ⏳ Once Gemma-tabular works at all, measure F1 + cost vs Claude on equivalent PDFs.

### 2026-05-03 · Move B follow-up: rhett759 (3 pages)

**Result:** `multipass-fhir-gemma-tabular × rhett759-quest-cmp (3 pages)` — **succeeded** in 49.8s, produced 17 bundle entries (2 Conditions + 15 Observations).

Comparable to `multipass-fhir × rhett759-quest-cmp` (all-Claude) from Move C: 17 entries, ~20s.

**Confirmed:** Gemma 4 31B works at small PDF sizes. The 25-page Cedars failure is specifically about long-PDF / large-image-payload constraint in the Google AI Studio API. **Architectural integrity intact**; the issue is API-layer.

**Surprising finding:** Gemma was *slower* than Claude on rhett759 (50s vs 20s wall-clock). Per-call Gemma latency on small PDFs is ~30–50s, vs Claude's ~10s. Cost win is real (~$0.12 vs ~$0.30 estimated) but **the speed advantage we expected from "smaller, cheaper model" doesn't materialize** at this PDF size.

**Updated decisions:**
- `multipass-fhir-gemma-tabular` is **not** the new default. Cost-only wins on small PDFs; broken on long PDFs.
- Reasonable to keep as a registered variant for cost-constrained dev workflows on small inputs.
- Real next step for cost-optimization: **page chunking on `GoogleAIStudioBackend`** so 25-page PDFs can split into 5-page chunks. Until then, Gemma-tabular is unfit for chart-export documents.

## 2026-05-03 · Move A — conditions prompt v1 → v2 on Cedars

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Rewrote the conditions pass system prompt to be more comprehensive (`v1` → `v2`). Bumped per-pass prompt version. Re-ran multipass-fhir on Cedars Health Summary.

**Why:** Move K.4's bake-off result showed condition recall at 0.11 (3/28). Hypothesis: the v1 prompt didn't enumerate where conditions hide in chart exports (Active Problems, PMH, Assessment, encounter diagnoses, screening exams, etc.). v2 explicitly lists all those sections and pushes for completeness ("be comprehensive — finding zero conditions on a chart export is unusual").

**How:** `multipass-fhir × cedars-health-summary` with new conditions prompt. Per-pass prompt versioning means only the conditions cache invalidates; other 4 passes re-extracted from scratch due to cache-key migration but with unchanged prompts.

Also: encountered a transient Anthropic API failure on the first attempt (Pass 0 returned `{}`); added a single retry to `_run_pass` for robustness.

**Result:**

| type | gt | extracted (v2) | extracted (v1) | TP | FP | precision | recall | F1 (v2) | F1 (v1) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| condition | 28 | **5** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 0.60 | 0.11 | 0.18 | 0.19 |

Other passes unchanged (same model, same data):

| type | F1 | unchanged |
|---|---:|---|
| medication | 0.92 | ✓ |
| allergy | 1.00 | ✓ |
| immunization | 0.89 | ✓ |
| lab | 0.70 | ✓ |

Overall weighted F1: **0.64 → 0.64** (unchanged within rounding).

**Conclusion:**

1. **The prompt change made the model more aggressive but did not increase TP count.** Recall stayed at 0.11; the 2 new extractions were FPs against ground truth.
2. **This may be the recall ceiling, not a prompt-tuning bottleneck.** The Cedars FHIR (`cedars-sinai.json`) contains 28 conditions covering the patient's entire chart history. The Health Summary PDF is a 25-page snapshot. It's plausible that **most of the missed 25 conditions simply aren't in the PDF at all** — Lucy/Epic Health Summary exports don't include every historical condition.
3. **Don't conclude the prompt is wrong without checking what's actually IN the PDF.** Need either:
   - Manual inspection of the 25 missed conditions to see which appear in the PDF text
   - A new eval mode that filters ground truth to "facts findable in the PDF" before scoring
4. **Two FPs are worth investigating.** Could be vision wins (real conditions in the document text not coded as Cedars Conditions) or hallucinations. Without manual review we can't tell.

**Decisions:**
- Conditions prompt **stays at v2** (more comprehensive is better even if F1 didn't shift on this PDF — should help on PDFs that DO have more findable conditions).
- Recall ceiling is real and worth surfacing in the eval harness — adding "GT-in-PDF presence check" to the backlog.

**Next:**

- ⏳ Add eval mode: filter ground-truth facts by "is this string findable somewhere in the PDF text?" before scoring. Resolves the recall-ceiling ambiguity.
- ⏳ Run conditions v2 on the other comprehensive PDFs (Sample H&P, Discharge Summary) — different documents may have different recall ceilings.
- ⏳ Continue Move B (currently re-running after pypdfium2 lock fix).

## 2026-05-03 · Move C — multipass vs baseline across Blake's full PDF set

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Ran the bake-off matrix against 6 PDFs (Cedars Health Summary, Function Health 7-29-2024, Function Health 11-29-2025, rhett759 Quest CMP fixture, Sample H&P, Discharge Summary). 12 cells total; only Cedars has ClientFullEHR ground truth.

**Why:** First bake-off only validated multipass on one PDF. Need to know whether the schema-direct multi-pass approach generalizes — particularly whether it provides value on lab-only PDFs (Function Health) where the baseline already extracts everything.

**How:** 2 pipelines (`single-pass-vision`, `multipass-fhir`) × 6 PDFs. Multipass uses default Claude Opus 4.7 for all 6 passes. Cache hits where present from K.4.

**Result:**

| PDF | baseline | multipass | delta | F1 (if GT) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cedars-health-summary | 3 | **156** | +153 | 0.64 |
| sample-h-and-p | 10 | **65** | +55 | — |
| discharge-summary | 5 | **20** | +15 | — |
| rhett759-quest-cmp | 15 | 17 | +2 | — |
| fh-2024-07-29-panel | 86 | 86 | 0 | — |
| fh-2025-11-29-panel | 58 | 58 | 0 | — |

Total wall-clock for all 12 cells: 178s.

**Conclusion:**

1. **Architecture choice is document-type dependent.** For pure lab PDFs (Function Health, rhett759), `multipass-fhir` produces the same fact count as `single-pass-vision` — the schema gap doesn't apply when the document only contains labs. Latency is ~70× higher for zero gain on these documents.
2. **For comprehensive chart PDFs (Cedars, H&P, discharge), multipass is essential.** The schema gap was hurting baseline by 15–153 facts per document on these. This is exactly the use case the architecture was designed for.
3. **Routing opportunity.** A pipeline router that detects lab-report-only documents and dispatches to `single-pass-vision` while routing chart documents through `multipass-fhir` would be ~70× faster on lab-heavy workloads with no quality loss. Defer until we have real workload data.
4. **Generalization confirmed.** Multipass works on every PDF tested without failures. Pass 0 + 5 parallel passes = robust orchestration.

**Next:**

- ⏳ Move A: prompt-tune the conditions pass (target conditions recall > 0.6 on Cedars).
- ⏳ Move B: per-pass Gemma swap (already wired as `multipass-fhir-gemma-tabular`; needs bake-off run).
- ⏳ Document-type detection / pipeline routing (deferred).
- ⏳ Acquire ground truth for at least one Function Health PDF (would let us measure baseline ≈ multipass quantitatively).

## 2026-05-03 · First bake-off — multipass-fhir vs single-pass-vision baseline

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.7

**What:** Built the [pipeline framework](../../ehi-atlas/ehi_atlas/extract/pipelines/) (Protocol + registry + bake-off harness), shipped two pipelines (`single-pass-vision` baseline + `multipass-fhir`), ran first bake-off against Blake's Cedars Health Summary PDF (25 pages, 189 ground-truth facts in `cedars-sinai.json`).

**Why:** Validate decisions 1–4 of `PDF-PROCESSOR.md`. The eval harness from earlier in the session showed `single-pass-vision` losing **161 of 189 ground-truth facts** to schema gaps (medications, allergies, immunizations, labs all 0/N). Schema-direct multi-pass should close the gap.

**How:** 2 pipelines × 1 PDF, both backends defaulting to Anthropic Claude Opus 4.7. Multi-pass uses 6 parallel calls (Pass 0 + 5 resource passes) via `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

**Result:**

| pipeline | weighted F1 | latency | bundle entries |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `single-pass-vision` | **0.03** | 1.3s (cache hit) | 3 |
| `multipass-fhir` | **0.64** | 93.7s | **156** |

Per-resource for `multipass-fhir`:

| type | gt | extracted | precision | recall | F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| medication | 7 | 6 | 1.00 | 0.86 | **0.92** |
| allergy | 1 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | **1.00** |
| immunization | 10 | 8 | 1.00 | 0.80 | **0.89** |
| lab | 143 | 138 | 0.71 | 0.69 | 0.70 |
| condition | 28 | 3 | 1.00 | 0.11 | 0.19 |

**Conclusion:**

1. **The architecture hypothesis holds.** 21× weighted-F1 improvement on the same PDF — schema-direct multi-pass is dramatically better than the bespoke `ExtractedClinicalNote` intermediate format.
2. **Conditions stayed at 0.11 recall on both pipelines.** Same model, same prompt — this is *not* a schema-gap finding, it's a prompt-quality finding for the conditions pass. Health Summary PDFs decompose conditions across visit-section subheadings ("Active Problems," "Past Medical History," "Reason for Visit") that the current prompt doesn't nudge the model toward.
3. **Lab precision = 0.71** with 40 false positives. Could be vision wins (clinical-note text never coded as Observations server-side) or hallucinations. Manual review pending.
4. **Cost trade: ~6× more per PDF, ~70× longer wall-clock.** Per-pass Gemma swap is the natural next experiment to claw back cost.

**Next:**

- ✅ `multipass-fhir` is the new default architecture.
- ⏳ **Prompt-tune the conditions pass** (target: condition recall > 0.6 on same PDF).
- ⏳ **Per-pass Gemma swap** for the high-volume tabular passes (medications, immunizations, lab observations).
- ⏳ **Run multipass against Blake's other PDFs** (Function Health 7-29-2024, Requested Record, Sample H&P, rhett759 fixture) — confirms generalization beyond Cedars.
- ⏳ **Manual triage of the 40 lab false-positives** — vision wins vs hallucinations.
